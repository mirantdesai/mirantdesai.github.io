						<h2>Quest for the Unknown</h2>
						<div class="row">
								<h3> <p>A spark that propels a car, wind that generates electricity, and hydroelectricity that now powers cars. Since the advent of the 20th century, the above mentioned accomplishments in scientific advancement continue to astonish the power of human creativity. </p>

<p>The 21st century marked a development of known innovations with a data-centric focus with advancements in cloud computing and computer technology that powers that almost all industries. We have also witnessed a growth of technology enabling human compassion to reach the furthest corners of the globe. Innovation in healthcare and medicine continue to push the boundaries on longetivity. 
There have been more satellites in space since the onset of the pandemic than any other time in history. This has enabled us to know our planet, navigate better, and locate resources than ever before. </p>

<p>So, as we look ahead, what are the questions that remain to be answered? Where will we focus our energies to advance humanity. Some of the questions that I have spent time deliberating on are regarding training artificial intelligence with morality. This can have significant implications on perceptions regarding individual self-concept, growth and development. It can also enable better judicial reform. </p>

<p>Next, another area of focus is possibly our quest for space exploration to understand space matter, and our relation to the cosmic space. This is possibly a scientific area that has not been explored in detail. As time progresses, some of these questions will help inform solutions to empower physical enablement, mind empowerment and spiritual advancement </p></h3>
