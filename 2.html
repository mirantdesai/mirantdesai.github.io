						<h2>Data Science in a day</h2>
						<div class="row">
								<h3> <p>So, as the aphorism goes - 'an apple a day keeps the doctor at bay'. I retain my agility by reading a variety of topics. Today, I was able to review data science as it relates to finance. To simplify the complexity, I have added a series of pre-requisites to develop a preliminary understanding of data science. </p>

<p>First, evaluate the business requirement where data science tools like Python and R can add more value as compared to the existing tools. Normally, this requirement emanates from larger datasets that require higher compute capacity, or sophisticated algorithms (Monte Carlo Simulations) to iterate a range of possibilities. The charting capabilities to these tools also create richer three dimensional visuals. </p>

<p>Next, select a cloud platform to spin up an instance of virtual machine that supports the Python scripting capabilities. Alternately, Jupyter notebooks also support scripting capabilities that can be locally installed on the computer. With these pre-requisities you can write your first few lines of code </p>

<p>Simplistically, the code can be broken into four key components. The first is the libraries that contains the supporting codes that support a set of operations. For example, Scikitlearn can perform machine learning operations, and Pytables can do the database storage and computations. The second, is the variable declaration of the key input variables, and the output pointers. The numeric and structured arrays enable the storage of large sets of information into the variable vector. Third, develop the computation formulas and the set of database and excel read operations to generate the output. Finally, the output requires to visualized in a compelling and informative manner that resonates with the audience. There are a set of libraries that enable this operation in addition to markdown capabilities that enable the display of information as a webpage.</p>

<p> Some example applications for finance include representing financial time series data, regression analysis, bayesian computations and statistical simulations.</p> </h3>
