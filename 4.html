								<h3> <p>
Humanity and philosophy? How do we transcend intelligence? Is it our comprehension of consciousness and conscientiousness that enables advancement, progress and compassion? A school of thought describes philosophy as the rational, abstract, and methodical consideration of reality as a whole or of fundamental dimensions of human existence and experience. We have tried to answer several elements as it pertains to our understanding of the mind, free will, our pursuit for knowledge, understanding of the self, and the interpretation of god. To categorize some fundamental principles
 </p>

<p><b><strong><u>Method of Doubt</u></strong></b> <p>

<p>Questioning prevailing economic theories, political structures, and existing paradigms enables a philosophical reasoning dimension. The key theory suggests that to establish anything one must be a contrarian to ordinary opinions and start from the fundamentals. A similar analogy, would be reasoning from first principles to identify a possible solution to a problem
</p>

<p><b><strong><u>The Knowledge of the Self</u></strong></b> <p>
<p>
The explanation of belief, and thought. How one person is fundamentally a representation of thoughts, values, principles and ideologies. This knowledge steers his conscientiousness to carefully select actions and decisions. And, this is perhaps what schools and universities hope to accomplish is the inculcation of true principles that will be of value to the society</p>

<p><b><strong><u>Virtual Reality</u></strong></b> <p>
<p> 

The firm foundational belief of knowledge is a stable understanding of the reality. There are universal axioms that determine our understanding of the world, and knowledge. Virtual reality is the representation of another idyllic present that is driven by core beliefs. We talk privacy as foundational human philosophy since we do question our existing beliefs on what is a true representation of a moral present.
</p>

<p><b><strong><u>The Idea of Perfection</u></strong></b> <p>
<p>

The idea of being perfect with no perceivable limitation is in philosophical terms indicative of a divine force. The quest for excellence is a true philosophical representation of this idea of perfectionism.
</p> 

<p><b><strong><u>The Philosophical Law of Thermodynamics</u></strong></b> <p>
<p>
A spark that sets fuel ablaze that generates energy to push a piston, thereby creating rotational force. This may suggest a philosophical butterfly effect of actions and the resulting implications. This possibly suggests restraint and re-examination of instincts to evaluate possible repercussions.
