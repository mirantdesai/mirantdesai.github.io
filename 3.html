						<h2>The Art of Music</h2>
						<div class="row">
								<h3> <p>The art of music. I have been fascinated by musicians and the art of expressing thoughts and emotions. My lower threshold for dissonant sounds meant that I did not learn guitar all too well. However, there were a lot of parallelisms that I was able to incorporate into my daily life and my approach to work.
 </p>

<p><b><strong><u>Picking Scales</u></strong></b> <p>

<p>The idea of selecting the scale emanates from a perfect pitch or a selection of chords that are in perfect harmony. This can be described as similar to the symmetric proportionality of the petals on a flower. The frequencies of sound follow similar scales. Similarities can be found in highly successfuly individuals who follow a schedule of tasks with perfect order and follow through in their tasks and duties. 
</p>

<p><b><strong><u>Tonalities</u></strong></b> <p>
<p>
The creativity of musicians to add tonality with a undertones, or overtones enables them to add a dimension of emotion to their art. I have found tonalities to equally creative in a professional context where the best orators are able to modulate the pitch of their voices to resonate with all audiences. Overtones can suggest confidence but also hostility. Similarly, undertones can be used express empathy and generosity.</p>

<p><b><strong><u>Transitions</u></strong></b> <p>
<p> 

A chord is a collection of three notes. A musical art is a combination of chords transitioning at a tempo in a defined order. The order of the chords enables repetition and a sense of belonging to a rhythm. We experience similar transitions everyday, when we get into work, talk a colleague, or complete a project. What makes a good transition is the element of consistency. 
</p>

<p><b><strong><u>Tempo</u></strong></b> <p>
<p>

This defines the number of beats per minute and the intent is to mirror an emotion that can express urgency or calm, happiness or sadness, and possibly other emotions. At various moments in life, you will find scenarios where you will have to flex your approach to a desired tempo to ensure you either follow through on stakeholder expectations, empathize with your colleagues or define order to assigned tasks
